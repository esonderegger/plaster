## A loudness level we can all agree on

By default, Plaster normalizes all podcast episodes to a loudness level of -18 LUFS when it encodes them to mp3.

The AES has [recommended](http://www.aes.org/technical/documents/AESTD1004_1_15_10.pdf) podcasts normalize their loudness levels to between -20 and -16 LUFS. Many of the most prominent NPR podcasts have already standardized on -18 LUFS.

Plaster makes it easy for your podcasts to be published at a consistent loudness level that won't make your listeners reach for the volume knob when they change feeds.
